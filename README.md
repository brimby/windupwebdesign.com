# Wind-up Web Design
## A simple web design portfolio built from scratch

### Explanation
I spent the last 4 years employed as a web app developer and I'd like to return to the world of website development. Only problem is, all the sites I created are more than 5 years old now (from before I became a full-time app dev) and have all been replaced by newer sites. So here's to new beginnings!

### Tech
