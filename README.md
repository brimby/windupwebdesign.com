# Wind-up Web Design - A simple web design portfolio built from scratch

### Explanation
I spent the last 4 years employed as a web app developer and I'd like to return to the world of website development. Only problem is, all the sites I created are more than 5 years old now (from before I became a full-time app dev) and have all been replaced by newer sites. So here's to new beginnings!

### Installation
Run `npm install` in the top directory to get aos, which is a library for doing animations triggered by scrolling.

### Tech
Pretty straightforward --- mostly just HTML and CSS going on right now, with a tiny bit of jQuery for doing smooth scrolling to anchors. Might bring in Angular later just for practice, but the site is so simple that it's mostly not worth doing.
